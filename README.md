Questions to think about
What will our tech stack be composed of?
Other imported libraries?
Database?
How will our project be available for online use?
DevOps? 
Do we need a domain to access the application via web browser, or focus on a local offline version of the application solely?
How do we define the stages of project readiness? Alpha, beta?
How can we create a useful documentation center? Meaning a central place people can go and read up on documentation related to the project
