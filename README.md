Tracking Events

How many days since ‘X’ event has passed?
How many times has ‘X’ event happened?
Last time I did ‘X’ event?

What other questions might users want answered? Add those questions too for functionality.

Example: On 1/1/2020: I drink liquor

Track how many days since then, the last time.
Track the individual calendar days/dates when it occurs again(analytics, most likely day to do ‘X’ or most likely trigger to do ‘X’)
Track a counter to increment if it happens again. Doesn’t have to happen every day, this feature is for checking something routinely. If it happened or if it didn’t.
Could be sobriety
Could be counting milestones
Good or bad uses possible

Questions to think about
What will our tech stack be composed of?
React, React Native
Other imported libraries?
Git
Database?
How will our project be available for online use?
DevOps? 
Do we need a domain to access the application via web browser, or focus on a local offline version of the application solely?
How do we define the stages of project readiness? Alpha, beta?
How can we create a useful documentation center? Meaning a central place people can go and read up on documentation related to the project
